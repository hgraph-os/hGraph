# Contribute

We welcome contributions in the form of [issues](https://github.com/hgraph-os/hGraph/issues/) or [pull requests](https://github.com/hgraph-os/hGraph/pulls). We recommend starting with an [issue](https://github.com/hgraph-os/hGraph/issues/new) to have a conversation before changing any files.

## Code of Conduct
Help us keep hGraph open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Topics for Contributing
For designers and engineers:
* What's version 2 of hGraph?
* Repo evolves from a demo into a production-ready component others can integrate with minimal effort
* CSS refinement of hGraph (making it beautiful)
* JS help to make hGraph an easy to use, plug n’ play JS library for visualizing data
* Scales beautifully for both desktop and mobile
* Provide multi-level view and connection of health data
[Determinants of Health](https://www.goinvo.com/vision/determinants-of-health/) (ex. Holistic view of all data, missing data)
* hGraph main, high-level view
* hGraph secondary detailed view
* Design the population hGraph for your neighborhood, city, clinic, nation.

For clinicians and researchers:
* Make a [hScore](https://github.com/hgraph-os/hScore). Evolve the scoring algorithm.
* What are the top metrics to show (at the "global" hGraph level)? What are the correct groupings and sub metric groupings?
* What are the chronic disease patterns (the outlines on hGraph) and how do we arrange the metrics to better see those conditions?
* What are we missing from the everyday diagnostic tool clinicians use? How do we improve hGraph to rock your in-patient encounter experience? Population diagnostic experience?

## Ways to Contribute

### Report issues
- Ensure the issue was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/hgraph-os/hGraph/issues/).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a [new issue](https://github.com/hgraph-os/hGraph/issues/new) and label it 'bug'. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a text sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggest new features
- Suggest your change as a [new issue](https://github.com/hgraph-os/hGraph/issues/new) and label it 'feature request' before writing any text.
- The team will review your new feature and respond within 24 business hours.

### Edit text or documentation
- No pull request is too small: fix typos, add comments, clean up inconsistent whitespace.
- Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- The team will review your pull request and respond within 24 business hours.

## Editing
### Instructions
First, make sure you're logged in with your Github account. When you have a change you wish to make, simply find the version of the document that you wish to change. Open it and press the Edit button.

On the edit page, you'll be presented with a version of the document. Edit the text you wish to change. When you are done editing, there will be a section at the bottom of the page to save your work. Under "Commit summary", enter a brief description of the change(s) you're making. In the "Extended description" field, explain what the changes are and why they're needed. Select the "Create a new branch for this commit..." option. When you're done, commit your changes.

At this point, you'll be presented with a form to submit a pull request. The bottom section of the page will show all of the changes you've made to the document, and all you should need to do is press the "Send Pull Request" button.

Once you've submitted a pull request, the PDUA team can review the work under the Pull Requests tab on the right-hand side, and a contributor to the repo can merge your changes.
